Memoization\n- Use React.memo for functional components\n- Use useMemo for expensive calculations\n- Use useCallback for function references\n\n### 2. Code Splitting\n- Implement React.lazy for component-level splitting\n- Use dynamic imports for route-based splitting\n- Consider bundle analysis tools\n\n### 3. Virtual DOM Optimization\n- Minimize unnecessary re-renders\n- Use keys properly in lists\n- Avoid inline object creation in render\n\n### 4. State Management\n- Keep state as local as possible\n- Use context wisely\n- Consider external state management for complex apps\n\n## Performance Monitoring\n- React DevTools Profiler\n- Chrome DevTools Performance tab\n- Web Vitals metrics",
